Got it 👍 Here’s a **README.md** for your frontend project. I’ve mentioned clearly at the top that the backend GitHub repository is separate.

```markdown
# Customer Management Frontend (React)

⚠️ **Note:** The **backend repository is separate** and must be set up before running this frontend.  
You can find the backend code here: [Backend Repository Link](https://github.com/your-backend-repo)

## 📌 Project Overview
This is the **frontend of the Customer Management System**, built using **ReactJS** with **Axios** for API calls and **React Router** for navigation.  
It allows users to perform **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on customers.  

The app is fully **responsive** and styled with **modern professional CSS**.

Make sure the **backend server** is running before using the frontend.

Example:

const API_URL = "http://localhost:5000/api/customers";
```

Would you like me to also **create a README for the backend repo** so that both look professional and linked properly?
